NOTES TO BOOK VII.

§ 12. aiebam cp. 6. 1. 10. It would be easy to make this assertion
if all the laws were not published to the people but kept back by the
pontifices and patres.

quodcunque, ‘ whatever final decision the people arrived at, that
should be legal and binding?

iussum . . . esse. The predicate here is iussum, ‘votes too embody
the command of the people‚’ i.e. the people expresses its will in an
election as much as in assenting to a law.

5 3. Fidei. (The consuls thought it) ‘a question of their honour,
not merely os their courage.’
5 4. quin, ‘ indeed,' ⁴ moreover.’
a patribus, ‘ from their fathers ;' 4. 2. 4 ‘ quam maiestatem senatus
ipsi a patribus accepissent.'
§ 5. in parte censeri. Cic. Flacc. 32. So ‘in tribu censere ' (Weiss).
obtinere, ‘ keep‚' ‘ retain.'
ξ 7. quam (ut) videant; 4. 2. 10 ‘potius quarn paterentur‚' ct saep.
nusquam alio=for no other purpose, literally, in no other di-
rection=ad nullam aliam rem, 4. 54. 7 (Weiss).
ξ 9. in campum descensum3 cp. Hor. Odes 3. 1. 10 :—
¹ Descendat in campum petitor.‘
So ‘ in forum,’ ‘in comitia descendere} and Cic. Phil. 2. 6. 15 ‘hodie
non descendit Antonius! Both the Forum and the Campus Martius
were on low ground.
per seditiones, ‘in quarrelling,' ‘rioting.'
ξ 10. a parte, ‘ by hals the people.’
per infrequentiam, ‘during their absence‚' cp. 5. 2. 5. In the
‘comitia centuriata’ it was not necessary for all the ‘centuriae' to
appear, provided the necessary majority (i.e. more than half the eentu-
ries) was obtained (Weiss.)

§ 1. in fidem consulis, ‘under the protection of,' ‘thrown them·
selvcs on his mercy.‘ Cp. Cic. Phil. 6. 5. 12 ‘qui vos in fidem suam
recep1t.'

ξ 2. alioquin, ‘in other respects' Cp. 37. 46. 6 ‘milites tantum,
qui sequerentur currum, defuerunt: alioquin magnificus triumphus
suit)

saevitum in; 1. 1 ‘Troia capta in ceteros saevitum esse Tro—
ianos.² The punishment inflicted may be compared with the decree
against Mitylene (Thuc. 3. 36) and the treatment of Melos (Thuc. 5
odfin).
vulgus aliud, ‘the mass of the populace.’
ξ 3. immolatis; supra 15. 10.
ξ 4. Samnites. While the Romans had been advancing southwards .
