the troops about three years before this time, in Β. c. 406. See 4. 59. 11 Chal),
‘Omnium maxime tempestivum principum in multitudinem munus, ut 2.
stipendium miles de publico acciperet;' and note the tribunes’ oppo-

sition to it in 4. 60, where they use arguments which are replied to

by Appius Claudius (infra, cap. 3).

ς 4. Venisse, from ‘ veneo?

iuventutem. The regular word sor ¹ soldiery ;' as infra, ς 5,
‘iuvenum;’ cp. 18. 10. ‘ Iuvenis* included persons between the ages
of about 20 and 40; cp. 6. 2. 6 ‘Dilectum iuniorum habuit, ita ut
seniores quoque in verba sua iuratos centuriaret.' Gellius says that
soldiers were called ⁴ iuniores' by Servius Tullius up to the age of 46,
and aster that ¹ seniores.'

§ 7. durare, ‘ was persevering‚' ⁴ holding on.’

quae . . . sir.. In Livy’s use of Oratio Obliqua, of which this
chapter gives a good instance, the present tenses of the subjunctive
are constantlyemployed with considerable freedom and effect3 infra,
ξ 10, ‘qui . . . admoneat;' and cp. 1. 9.14, 153 4. 2; 4. 35. ‘Sit ’ is
here present because the statement is of universal application‚ a general
truth, ‘ winter which is a time of rest for every man.’

ξ 8. Hoc with servitutiS‚ ‘such a badge os slavery.’ See note on
Genitive in Exeursus, p. 27.

'I'ribuni plebis were appointed in Β. C. 494 aster the first secession
of the plebs.

triste dictatoris imperium. There was no appeal <‘ provocatio ¹)
from the sentence of a dictator. Cp. 4. 26 ‘ severissimi imperii virum
dictatorem dixit.' For triste = ‘ stem ' see Index.

importunos = cruel, tyrannical.

ut . . . facerent.. Explanatory of ‘ Hoc . . . servitutis.'

Quod tribuni . . . exercerent. In this, and the question in the
next section, Livy writes as though ‘ rogitantes ’ were expressed3 sor in
ordinary Oratio Obliqua, questions in the Ist and 3rd persons are turned
into the infinitive mood, questions in the 2nd into the subjunctive.
Weissenborn quotes 7. 15. 2 ‘Ecquis sequeretur eorum qui . . . ,' but
there ⁴ increpans rogitansque ’ precedes the semi-Oratio Obliqua.

ξ 9. proconsularem imaginem, ‘the mere semblance of consular
power‚’ i.e. the military tribunale.

uui plebeio. The first plebeian elected as ‘tribunus militurn con-
sulari potestate' was P. Licinius Calvus; infra, 12. 9.

§ 10. obtinendazto administer their office. Cp. 30. 19 ‘ Ut Galliam
atque Italiam armis obtineant.' The use of ‘ obtinere' = ‘to get’ as well
as ‘to hold* is quite classical ; but with official duties the latter is more
usually the meaning conveyed.

in turba .. . haerere. ‘ Not even one to bring up the rear.'
Weissenborn quotes Cic. Vat. 5. 11 ‘ Nunc te . . . extremum haesisse.’
