32 ΟΝ THE ROMAN ARMY AT THIS PERJOD.

of the whole being 6} st. This was now the arm of the Hastati
and Principes, and later on was also used by the Triarii.

(3) A short two-edged swerd.

The Velites wore a cap ofleather or skin (galea), and a light
shield (parma), and their weapons were the sword and light
spears. The earlier Rorarii and Accensi seem only to have
used darts and staves, which they discharged, and then fell
back to the rear.

Officers.—Each legion had at its head six Tribuni militum,
at first all nominated by the consuls. After 362 Β. C. six out of
the usual twenty-four were elected by the people (Livy 7. 5. 9).
These tribuni a populo, whose number in 207 B.C. had risen to
twenty-four, are distinguished from the rz4lelz' (za consule
sacti). The tribunes were not men who had risen from the
ranks 3 they were generally young men of senatorial or equestrian
family.

Each of the centurics of the legion had a Centurion.
The centurions were annually appointed by the consul through
the tribunes. They were arranged in grades according as they
belonged to the Hastati, Principes, or Triarii, and to a higher
or lower century in these divisions, from the lowest century of

the Hastati up to the highest of the Triarii. The centurion of ,

this latter was called primi pili centurio, Livy 7. 41. 5, and held
a specially privileged position, even taking part in the council
of war with the tribunes.

Troops of the AHies.—Aster the aequum fhedus made by
Sp. Cassius with the Latins in 493 B.C., till the end of the
Latin war, the Latins as well as the Romans sent their contin-
gent to the army of the league. But they were now beginning
to be irregular in their supply of troops. (Cp. Livy 6. 6. 4, Sec.)
From Livy 8. 8. 15 it appears that their arms and organisation
were the same as those of the Romans. Cp. Livy 6. 32. 7 ‘ La-
tinae . . . legiones, longa societate militiam Romanam edoctae.’
