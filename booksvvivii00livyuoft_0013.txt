the theory and practice still being that the state owned the
publicus ager, and granted it to occupiers, retaining, as we
should say, the freehold in itself. The third directed the abo-
lition of the office of military tribunes with consular power, and
expressly enacted that of the two consuls one must always be a
plebeian. The first caught the votes of the humblest classes;
the second was a bait sor the more well-to-do and the sarmers:
the third betrayed the real reason of the attitude of these cham-
pions of the plebs.

It is impossible with the scanty materials which we possess
to judge accurately of the justice or injustice of the proposals
with reference to usury. So far as we can see, the laws of
Rome gave an enormous power to the money-lenders—a law of
the XII Tables even allowed the creditors to divide among
themselves the body of an insolvent debtor3 and though a law
so atrocious must have virtually defeated itself, its very presence
among the statutes of the Romans shows that it was an enact-

practically at the mercy of a relentless creditor. Even in more
enlightened times, when statesmen have attempted to legislate
sor a financial crisis, the remedies proposed usually betray a
strange amount of inability on the part of those who wish to
cope with a difficulty which they either do not understand
or which they are compelled to meet in such a manner as will
satisfy the clamour of ignorance and interested prejudice. The
grievance of debt had in earlier days brought about the first
secession of the plebs3 and even if the measures brought
sorward by Licinius failed to remove the causes which underlay
the financial troubles of Rome, they at least alleviated the dis-

and dissension between the orders.

Viewed thus, with regard to the internal and constitutional
development of the nation, these three books constitute one of
the most important chapters of Roman history. The success
