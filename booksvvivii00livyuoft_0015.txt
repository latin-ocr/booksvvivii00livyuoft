LIVY AS Α HISTORIAM 11

legends invented by a later age to conceal, if possible, that
which was felt to disgrace the Empress of the world. Yet
there is a grandeur of language at the very outset of that
memorable invasion of the Gauls, and a sustained vigour during
the whole of the narrative, which cannot fail to impress and
rivet the reader's attention, Livy has at once the defects and
the merits of a poet3 he does not care much to sift truth from
legend, but skilfully blends the two together in such a manner
as to form an admirable and striking picture, while the very ease
with which he painted it has made the figures stand out life-

have been spoilt by a more prosaic treatment. The subordinate
parts also are not less clearly treated; indeed few writers could
have given such interest to the endless tales of petry wars
which he had to recount, each a repetition of its predecessor,
yet sufficiently varied to escape at least from the censure of
monotony and dulness. As minor points of ingenuity in com-
position may be noted the tale of the seizure of the Veientine
prophet by the powerful Roman soldier, where the very corn-
plexity of the sentence seems to illustrate the subtle combina-
tion and cunning of the device3 the ignominious return of the
schoolmaster at Falerii, scourged by his own pupils whom he
had intended to betray to the enemy; the attitude of the people
of Tarquinii, transacting all the business of everyday life while
