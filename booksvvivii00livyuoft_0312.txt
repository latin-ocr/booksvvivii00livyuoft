§ 6. lustro. Once in each five years an expiatory (‘ luo’) offering was
made aster the census had been taken, and the sacrifice ‘ suovetaurilia ²
performed.

ξ 9. eopia. The emphasis is not so much on the number (six),
because that for some years had been the regular number os ‘ tribuni mili-
tum consulari potestate ; ’ buton the sact that tribunes, not consuls, were
appointed by the interrex. Itis impossible not to notice, throughout these
constitutional difficulties, that the senate is really the permanent element
in the government of Rome. Their consultum obtains the resignation os
magistrates, cp. supra 9. 1, when a vote is taken on this same question ;
and a nominee of theirs among the officials, or one who supported their
authority, could ensorce it by appointing a dictator, from whom there
was no appeal. The senate's real term os power began with the Second
Punic War, and lasted till the time of the Gracchi ; but there can be no
doubt that an assembly composed os officials and exc-officials had a
considerable advantage over annual magistrates, especially when the
latter usually belonged to the same ‘ ordo ‘ as the majority os the senate.

July. In honour of C. Julius Caesar this was afterwards called Iulius

rate this utterance.
