cui se might mean, (1) asking husband and son ‘to what sate they
were dooming themselves ς’ (zi ‘ to what sate they were leaving them.’ But
this would rather require ‘ relinquerent.’ as in 3. 52. 4. It seems best to
take ‘se dare’ as reflexim, and translate (3) ‘to what fate they (the
women) were to submit' (the question would be ‘ cui nos sato demus?’).

human suffering? Cp. Tac. Ann. 1. 21 ‘nihil reliqui faciunt quominus
invidiam . . . permoverent.’
