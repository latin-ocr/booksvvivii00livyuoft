THE PRESENT EDJTJON. 13

what it could not fail to lose in independence and honesty of
judgment. Thus, whether from personal bias or from imperial
influence, the historian os Rome cannot be called an impartial
writer. He has his prejudices, as all men have ; and yet, from
his narrative of events, although a hasty perusal may be mis-
leading, the truth can be still sifted by careful criticism, and
the real connexion of cause and effect, with the general ten-
dencies of the various movements, observed.

The notes were at first written without reference to other
authorities or commentator53 additions were afterwards made,
chiefly from Weissenborn’s well-known edition (4th ed.) and, it
is believed, have been in most cases acknowledged. It is
hoped that the work bestowed on these three books may prove
a help to the student towards the mastering of difficulties
and also induce him to follow out for himself the chief aim of
the editor-—to present the Latin language in a thoroughly
English form and to give some life and reality to a study which
too often becomes dull and insipid from carelessness and
want of sympathy. The Excursus (pp. 15—29) does not pretend
to be at all complete, but may serve as a clue to Livy's style
and use of language. (For fuller treatment of the subject see
Kiihnast‚ Die Hazlplptmkle der Lz'vz'am‘sclzen syntax.) The
Index too is intended as a guide rather to the language than
the subject-matter of these books. For reference to the history
the Analyses at the head of each chapter will, it is hoped, be
sufficient. The Map of Central Italy and the Note on the
Army are added in the hope of enlivening the military aspect
of Livy’s narrative.

The text, by the kind permission of Professor Madvig, is
taken from his second edition (1875). It may be well to add
that words in z'talz‘cs have been supplied to the text3 words in-
cluded in brackets [ ] are considered doubtful or unnecessary3
and an obelisk (†) shows that the passage is corrupt.
