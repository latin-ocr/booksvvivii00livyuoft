‘ab' are also found: 4. 6. 5 ‘Quum Canuleius victoria de patribus in· Chal).

ξ 11. donum: infra 25. 10, a golden drinking-bowl was sent, and,
as told in chap. 28, the ship of war that conveyed it was captured by
pirates from the Lipari islands, but subsequently released.

instaurata, ‘ renewed‚' ‘ repeated.’ The word is constantly used to

describe the repetition of a solemn act which has been interrupted,
or the due performance of a ceremony not rightly observed. In Aen.
4. 63 ‘instauratque diem donis,' VirgiL as usual, carries the meaning
a little further, and indeed transfers its sense in his favourite manner;
but the examples quoted from his poems all retain the notion of
repetition.

ς 1. ingens, cp. 4. 6. 5 ‘ quum Canuleius victoria de patribus et plebis Chap-
savore ingens esset.’ 17.

§ 2. ubi =in what point, in what particular.

Latinam, i. e. the Latin festival. The ‘ Feriae Latinae' were yearly
celebrated to Jupiter Latiaris, with games in Rome, cp. 19, ξ 1, and a
solemn sacrifice on the Alban Mountain. Since Rome became head of
the Latin League the sacrifice was presided over by her chief magistrate.

sacrum in monte Albano, 1. 31 ‘feriae per novem dies.'

concepisse. There were three kinds of festivals among the
Romans: ‘stativae,’ regularly reeurring on fixed days; ‘ conceptivae,'
moveable feasts, the date of which was fixed afresh each year; and
‘ imperativae‚' extraordinary‚ ordered to celebrate some special event.

ξ 3. auspicia. As impem'um is the technieal term for the power,
civil and military, of the magistrate, so auspicium expresses his relation to
the gods. They are two sides of the same thing. The auspicia maxima
only belong to the highest magistrates; interrex, consul, praetor, officers
of consular or praetorian power. If there was any defect or informality
in the position of the magistrate, the auspices had to be renewed by
reference to the patrician Senate (patres) who appointed an interrex.

interregnum. The first instance is after the death of Romulus,
1. 17, when the ‘ patres' divided the power among themselves, forming
‘ decuriae‚’ and each holding office for five days.

56. ad. fanum Voltumnae. A similar meeting had been held just
before the beginning of the war with Veii, 4. 61. Cp. 4. 23. 2 5.
Voltumna was the tutelary goddess of the Etruscans, cp. 6. 2. 2.

ξ 7. quia, &c.: ‘because the Veientians ought not to ask for help
from those from whom they had not asked advice with regard to so
important a step.’

fortunam, ‘ their own position refused it to the Veientians ’ (⁶ illis ‘).
ξ 8. satis fida, ‘ really secure.³
