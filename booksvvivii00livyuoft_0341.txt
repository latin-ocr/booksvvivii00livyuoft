regibus. The early history of Rome, sor which the usual dates
given are from 754—5 10 B.C.‚ is too uncertain to have its periods actually
fixed. Consuls (Brutus and Collatinus) were first appointed Β. C. 510
(1 ad fin.); and this, the highest magistraey in the Roman state, remained
till the imperial period, being at times interrupted by the appointment
of a dictator, once by ‘ decemviii' (451—449 B. C.)‚ and afterwards
by the appointment of ‘ tribuni militares cum consulari potestate‚’
444-367 B.C., 4. 7 to end of this book. During this period consuls
were occasionally elected.

commentariis pontificum. The pontifices kept an official list of
the annual chief magistrates, and to this formal record were gradually
added notices of important events so as to form something like a regular
chroniele. (Mommsen, History of Rome, i. p. 476.)
