classes; but it was none the less wholesome and necessary.
W'hen on one or two occasions the patricians by an elec-

establishment of a military despotism.

Livy himself anticipates that his readers would be more

true that some of his finest passages (e.g. the timely interven-
tion of Camillus at the moment when the Romans were bar-
gaining for gold with their barbaric conquerors) are records of
