NOTES TO BOOK V.

ξ 1. aeris gravis, ‘money os sull weight‚' in which the As = one
pound, about Sd. of our money. Its weight was reduced first to four
ounees, and then in the First Punic XVar it sunk to two, and in the Second
Punic VVar, haw'ng sunl-t still further. was fixed at one ounce (B.C. 217).
Finally, by the lex Papiria of 89 B. c. it was reduced to half an ounce.

Mars communis=the fortune and chances of war. Cp. ‘aequo
Marte‚’ ‘ pari Marte‚' ‘ verso Marte,· ‘ incerto Marte,' ‘ Mars anceps?

§ 3. praesentem, ‘immediate' ‘Praesens pecunia‘=cash payment.

legem agrariam. First in Livy 2. 4¹·

ξ 4. quum, ‘sinee.‘ ‘Ita prospere’ is obviously ironical——‘ with such
success that in no case were their hopes realised.’

ξ 5. actae. The original meaning os the word, ‘driven‚' shows the
kind of plunder usually taken, that is, cattle: just as the derivation of
‘pecunia’ from ‘pecus‘ points to the fact that the earliest form of
wealth consisted in cattle.

§ 6. postquam . . . erat, ‘when they found assault useless.'

provincia. The word has been variously derived as a contractiori
from ‘providentia‚' ‘pro—noventia’ (cf. ‘nuntius'=the charge assigned
to a delegate), and from ¹ pro-vincere) ‘It is not certain what was the
original meaning, but it is used generally of a magistrate's ‘sphere of
duty‚’ and especially, as here, os a command in war outside the city.
Later it was applied to a conquered territory and its administration.

ξ 7. maiore mole, ‘more imposing proportions.' After ‘quam' ¹
there is an ellipse. ‘than (those in which) the wars were being con-
ducted.’

spoken.

§9- usurpandi iuris: sor the sake of making a precedent, exer-
cieing‚ claiming the right.

5 11 vetus senator. Itis worth notice that a plebeian could be
a senator: the social distinction between‘ patres' and‘ plebs) chiefly
maintained by the denia] of the‘ ius connubii’ before the tribunate of
Canuleius (4. 2, &c.)‚ had been used to exclude them from the chief
official posts. But after a share in the consulship was secured to
the plebs by the Lieiniau laws, 367 B.C., a new conception of nobility
arose founded on tenure of office, without regard to patrician birth.
Hence in later history, though the patricians retain certain honorary
privileges, many plebeian families rank quite as high, and long descent
was as highly valued among the one as the other. Tac.Ann.6. 14 a grand-
niece of Tiberius, daughter of Germanicus, married L. Cassius, ‘ plebeii
generis, verum antiqui honoratique.’

1 ξ 12. neo satis constat=and no good reason is given, it is not really
c ear.
