the enemy had actually entered the open gates of their t0wn;
and the well-timed generosity of M. Manlius, answered by the
impetuous gratitude of the centurion whom he liberated, so
graphically characteristic of the easily-roused Italian character.
More particularly too may be noticed the apt language, the
words and phrases with which Livy contrives to present so
clearly the feelings of a class or an individual. Of the speeches
recorded by him, all have this trait peculiarly distinet and
appropriate3 and betray at once the composition of the man
of letters and his ready ability to seize the attitude of the
speaker and the words which express that attitude most vividly.
The most elaborate of all—the address by which the people of
Capua sought to win alliance with the Romans—if not exactly
modelled on the speech of the Corcyraean envoys in the first
book of Thucydides, strongly reminds the reader of it, and in
its argument, urging the question of expediency as against*
formal rights, certainly goes over the same ground. But simi-
larity of circumstances, possibly coupled with an unconscious
recollection of that which might have served as a model, will
sufficiently account for the resemblance3 for Livy was not a
writer who was in need of the dangerous assistance supplied by
plagiarism. It would occupy too much space to quote instances
of this aptness of language in detai13 but a careful attention to
it will amply repay any reader, who tries sor himself to turn
Livy's phrases by the English which is really suited to them.
The speech of Appius Claudius towards the end of the sixth
book may be referred to as one of the most admirable instances
of his power, expressing as it certainly does a great deal of the

resistance to these plebeian agitators. Sympathy with men
who sought to upset or reform the existing order of things is
not to be expected from the great writers of the Augustan age.
