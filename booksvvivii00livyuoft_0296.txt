sortes. Yirg. Aen. 6. 72 ‘ tuas sortes arcanaque sata,' of the Sibyl.

§ 1. Priusquam. When this conjunction and ‘antequam’ are used
with subj. (except in Oratio Obliqua) there is generally some notion os
purpose; but not always. See Roby, Lat. Gr. 1674. Simple time is
not expressed by the subjunctive, if we except ‘quum ’ with plups. subj.
sor ‘ aster that‚’ and an occasional use of ‘ quum’ with imps. subj.

ᾗ 2. multis bellis. The ablatives all depend upon ‘ occupatos!

ξ 3. cohortes expeditas=a flying column, i.e. without ‘impedi-
menta ;’ ‘ light-armed ’ hardly conveys the exact meaning.

eoque, and ‘therefore too weak (to stop them)—.'

ξ 4. indignitas, ‘indignation,' as it is joined with ‘cura‚’ each

signifies the exact right of ownership which, in the case os ‘res mancipi,'
could be possessed by a Roman citizen, and in the strict legal sense by
no one else. But by ‘usucapio' prcscriptive rights could be acquired
even by a stranger, and the praetor's equitable jurisdiction would pre·

undisputed possession for one year os moveables and for two years of
immoveables gave an indeseasible title.

gained in battle or os the authority of the magistrates.
