NOTES To BOOK VII.

§ 1. uncini-ium fenus. See Orelli on Tac. Ann. 6. 16 ‘duodecim
tabulis sancitum, ne quis unciario fenore amplius exerceret) lt is an
uncia or 3¹35 of the principal per annum as interest, reckoned on the
old year of ten inonths=813 per cent.‚ and on the twelve months=
10 per cent. (100 >< 5¹3 >< ἦξε 10). Nipperdey (on Tac. loc. cit.) explains
it as ἦ per cent. a month=1 per cent. per annum; but this mode of
reckoning by the month was later. See Roby, Lat. Gr. 1. Appendix D.
It is curious that Livy should say nothing about this law of the
Twelve Tables, which is quoted only by Tacitus. The difficulties
encountered in the attempt to regulate the rate os interest are well
illustrated in Cic. ad Att. 5. 21. 11.

ξ 2. ad=praeter (Weiss).

crimine, here = offence (Weiss).

ς 3. nihil in publicum, contrasting with the conduct os Camillus,
5. 20. , For the phrase cp. 5. 23. 10.

ς >45 inquit aster exclamat is pleonastic, cp. ι. 45. 6; 8. 9. 4
(Weiss). ’
(Anavaturos, connected with ‘ navus ' (‘ gnavus‚' ep. ‘ ignavus’) and
γιγνώσκω, = to act vigorously.

ξ 5. celsi, ‘ proud,’ ‘triumphant.'

Sex. Tullius; supra 13, 14.

§ 6. fusum, ‘hostem'

§7. novo exemplo. The precedent was not followed; but the
fact that personal voting was necessary in Rome osten made its ξ
‘ comitia’ only half express the feelings of the whole body of ‘ cives‚‘

vicesima, ‘ five per cent.’ The revenue of Rome at this time con-
sisted of—
1. The income from public lands and buildings.
2. Indi¹·ect taxes, especially harbour-dues (portoria, Liv. 2. 9. 6).
3. The tributum, an extraordinary tax levied in time of war; this
became more frequent with the regular payment of the troops
aster 13.C. 406.
4. Special and extraordinary revenues, such as—
(a) salt-monopoly.
(b) vicesima libertatis (the tax here mentioned).
(c) spoils os war.
(cl) confiscated goods and fines.
But in the later Republic the main income of the state came from the
provinces in the form of taxes or rent from public land, so that it was
possible to abolish the tributum in 167 B.C.
manumitterentur. The word is compounded from the actual
ceremony ‘ per vindictam‚' the liberating rod with which the freed slave
was touched and sent away.
