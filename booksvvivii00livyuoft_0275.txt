ξ 1. Comitia. ‘ Comitium ab eo quod coibant eo,' says an old Latin Chap,
writer. The three Roman Comitia were the Curiata, Centuriam, 1.
and T ributa. The distinctive name was given to each, according to
the manner in which the voting was conducted. At the Curiata,
the people voted in ·’ curiae.' Romulus was said to have divided his
subjects into thirty euriae, ten for each os his three Tribes‚ each curia
containing ten gentes. Originally, it was the important assembly;
afterwards, its functions became limited to ceremonial matters, e. g. the
choice of certain priests, and the adoption ζ· arrogatio ³) of persons who
were ‘ sui iuris,' and the passing of the lex curiata de imperio conferring
command. In the Centuriam the people voted according to their cen-
turies, the division attributed to Servius Tullius, and based upon pro-
perty qualifications. To this assembly were limited the choice of some
of the higher magistrates, the voting of aggressive wars, and questions
affecting the life and ‘civitas' of any citizen. After B. C. 494 the
Plebs became a corporation with officers (tribuni plebis) and an
assembly, which met by tribes. This meeting, though technically only
a cmzcilium plebis, and not strictly Comitia populi, gradually acquired
full legislative power (finally and unconditionally by lex Hortensia, B.c.
287), and is often called Comitia T ributa by the historians. It elected
tribunes, and plebeian aedilec,and was the important legislative assembly.
Modern authorities are not agreed whether there was also a Comitia
T ributaproper, i. e. an assembly of the populus Romanus by tribes ; but
if there was, its functions were not extensive (see Madvig, Die l'erfassung
und Verwaltung des Rb'mz'sclzen Staats, Kap. iii. ξ 5; Mommsen,
Riimisclze Forsckungen, Art. Rome in Encycl. Britann.) The Comitia
Centuriata, being a military meeting, was held ontside the city in the
Campus Manius, the Comitia Curiata in the Comitium, to the north-
east of the Forum, and the Assembly os the Plebs in the Forum.

§ 2. tribuni militum consulari potestate. First appointed Β. c.
444, cp. Book 4. 7. They were elected to the chief magistracy in the
place of consuls, as a device to prevent the surrender to the plebs of the
right os eligibility to the consulship. But a plebeian was not elected to
the military tribunate till Β. C. 400.
