A'OTES TO BOOK V.

Chap. ξ 3. id= one point, the following point.

35- solamne . . . adiutam: the aecus. by attraction into the case os
‘hanc gentem venisses the ordinary construction would be ‘parum
certum est utrum sola venerit?

ξ, 4. invisitatas, This compound word seems to have been used to
avoid the ambiguity which would have arisen if the simple ‘invisus,’
which also = hami, had been employed sor ‘unseen:' -- strange,
uncommon.

adversus Romanos, ‘ in regard t0,' ‘withf Cp. 36. 3, note.
nisi quod, ‘ except the fact that‚' ¹ unless because?

ξ 5. agerent cum Gallis ne, ‘remonstrate with the Gauls against
their attack on.'

ξ 6. The whole of this section, in Oratio Obliqua, forms part of the
instructions given to these envoys.

bellum ipsum, ⁴ the war as it was‚' ‘ the existing war.’

Chal,- ξ 1. mitis . . . ni, for mitis fuisset ni. The shortest rendering
36. of this elliptical sorm is ‘the mission was peacesul (simple), but the
envoys were fiery men, more like Gauls than Romans.’ The present
subjunctive used throughout the following short pieee of Oratio Obliqua

is to be noted.

ξ 2. quorum . . . sit imploratum, probably would be subj. in Oratio

Recta, ‘since the Clusians had called on them sor assistance in their ·

time of need ’—the relative introducing a reason.
§ 3. adversus se, if with ‘legatione‘ = by embassy to them <the
Gauls); if with ‘tueri socios' = against them (the Gauls).
Clusini. The subject, by a common idiom of construction, is really
out of place, being put in the relative when it belongs first to the prin-
cipal clause. ‘ Is the Clusians would resign a portion of their territory

to the Gauls who were in want of land, of which the Clusians hold
more than they cultivate!

quem latius = cuius plus.

ξ 5. This sentence is worth studying as an instance os elever con-
struction, peculiarly Latin. ‘Romanis quaerentibus' depends on ‘quum
illi dicerent,' and the two clauses ‘ quodnam . . . esset,⁷ and ‘quid rei . . .
essct ' follow on ⁵ quaerentibus.' Keeping some os the arrangement, we
may render it, ‘ on the Romans inquiring what kind os right was this, to
demand land from its occupiers οι· to threaten war, and what business
the Gauls had in Etruria, when the latter proudly replicd that they
carried their right in their swords‚ and that the world belongs to the

brave, the passions os both sides were aroused and they rush to arms and
join battle.'
§ 6. urgentibus, ‘ dooming‚' ‘ were heavy on.'
