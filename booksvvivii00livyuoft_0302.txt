attending to what was happening behind them.
servitiis. The abstract word both in singular and plural is used
sor the concrete ‘ slaves?

ξ 11. Shouts rend the air, the eries ofattack and the shrieks of dismay,

ct Gallis territandi et pavendi suit Romanis.’

‘horae
Momento cita mors venit aut victoria laeta?

ξ 13. senescit pugna, ‘the fighting flags.'

5 14. aliquantum maior, ‘considerably larger than he expected or
thought! So ‘ aliquoties’ usually implies some large number, not· so
indefinite as our ‘ some.’

rerum, ‘consisting of objects of greater value.’ It is a sort of
genitive of material, dependent on praeda.

ς 15. ut, repeated ut . . . liceret.

eam invidiam, we might say ‘to remove the danger? Compare
the story of Polycrates of Samos and Hdt. 7. 46 ὁ θεὸς φθονερὸς
εὑρίσκεται ἐών, and 1. 32 τὸ θεῖον πᾶν ἑὸν φθονερόν τε καὶ ταραχῶδες.
Eam invidiam is almost=eius invidiam ; see Excursus, p. 26.
