NOTES TO BOOK V. 1
Chap. ξ 3. iniuriae vestrae, ‘ the wrong which you did to me.’
54. ⁴ caelum . . . educatus. Juvenal 3. 84, 85 :—
ἒ

‘Usque adeo nihil est, quod nostra infantia caelum
Hausit Aventini?'

moveant . . . macerent, ‘ a wish,' like the Greek optative. The
present subjunctive is usually employed when the wish is likely to be
fulfilled‚ the imperfect when its realisation is impossible, either in itself
or according to the speaker's belief.

caritate sua, ‘ your affection sor them ; ' ‘ suus,' objective, cp. vestrae
above.

ξ 4. mediterraneis, ‘ inland)
expositum agrees with snare, but in sense goes with locum; ‘the
sea was near enough for every convenience, but not so near as to expose
the city,’ &c. Ostia was less than twenty miles srom Rome.
mediam, reckoning from North to South.
ξ 5. natum unice, ‘ specially designed by nature.’
tot . . . tam . . . tantum. A characteristic Latin usage, which we
should turn by ‘ all these‚' ‘ with its enormous power!
oppida. In apposition to Volsci, ‘ and all their powerful cities.'
latitudinem obtinens Italiae, ‘ occupying the whole breadth of
Italy ;' supra 33. 9 ‘ ei (Etrusci) in utrumque mare vergentes?
ξ 6. malum3 interjectional‚ ‘in Heaven's name?
expertis. There is apparently some corruption here; but as the '
text stands, the meaning is clear, ‘what reason is there for you, who
have had experience, to try something new?’ Perhaps ‘ talia' or
‘laeta’ has fallen out. Madvig and Ussing, comparing supra 21. 12
‘deiectis armatis ; ' 40. 40. 15 ‘ exauctoratis militibus impositis ;’ Tac.
Ann. 12. 14 ‘ profligatis obversis} say ‘ sortasse scribendum erat spretis
expertis: which would mean ‘ despising those who have had experience ;“
or if ‘ expertus ’ be taken in its passive sense, as frequently used in and
after the Augustan period, ‘scorning experience.‘ As the MSS. have
‘ expertis latos alia,’ ‘ laetos’ and ‘iratos' have been conjectured for ‘ latos.‘
ut, ‘ supposing that ;' supra 53. 2 ‘ ut ego non (licam.'

ᾗ 7. eapite humano; 1. 55. 5 ‘eaput humanum integra facie aperi-
entibus fundamenta templi dicitur apparuisse.' Compare the legend of
the foundation of Carthage by Dido, Virg. Aen. 1. 443 :-—·

‘Est'odere loco signum, quod regia Iuno
Monstrarat, caput acris equi; sic nam fore bello
Egregiam et facilem victu per saecula gentem.' l

liberaretur, ‘ was being freed “ (from buildings which obstructed
the view). Cp. Cic. Leg. 2. 8. 21.
