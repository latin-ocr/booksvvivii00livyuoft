Stolo. Weissenborn quotes Varro de Re Rust. 1. 2. 9 ‘quod nullus
in eius fundo reperiri poterat stolo, quod effodiebat circum arbores e
radicibus quae nascerentur e solo, quos stolones appellabant!

§ 6. forem . . . percuteret. Cp. Pliny 7. 1¹2 ‘ Cn. Pompeius intra-
turus Posidonii domum fores percuti de more vetuit?

insueta: used with genitive, dative, adjective, and infinitive.

ξ 7. stimulos . . . subdidit=stungl1er; for a little thing will excite

a woman's feelings.

foolish idea (“ arbitrium,” opinion) which makes all persons unable to
bear to be distanced by their relatives.'

ξ 8. piam, ‘ affectionate '—afl'ection being, as it were, the ‘ dutisulness '
between sisters. See note on 6. 2 3. 12.

ξ 9. impari, ‘to one beneath her.' As the ceremony of marriage
