NOTES TO BOOK V.

ξ 8. sit. As osten, Livy makes the Oratio Obliqua less dull by his
use os present instead os past tenses; ‘eant,' ‘ impediant!

§ 9. id, anticipating and explained by the sueceeding clause. So
eum in the next sentence is emphatic: ‘the report at Rome was that
the number os the enemy which came under these conditions was large.‘

ξ 1. praerogativa, sc. ‘ centuria? In the voting at the Comitia the
unit taken was the ‘centuria‚' or ‘ tribus.' Is a candidate obtained a
bare majority in eighteen tribes—the sull number being thirty-five-
no account was taken os the numerical majority os individnal votes
which might be against him in the other seventeen. The word ‘ prae-
rogativa' signifies the tribe or century which was first called upon to re—
cord its vote. In the early days of the Comitia Centuriam the centuries of
Equites voted first (Liv. 1. 43. 11), and as late as 296 Β. c. this arrange-
ment seems to have prevailed (Liv. 10. 22. ι). 1t was not till this
assembly was modified on a tribal basis that a praerogativa centuria
was chosen by lot. Livy here anticipates the later arrangement. (See
Madvig, Die Verfizssungund Verwalluug des Rb'tm'schcn Staats, Kap. ii.

of an election, either by the ‘praeco' or by the presiding magistrate.
Also used of the report made by the official who observed the omens.

was ‘ obnuntio,‘ to announce some bad omens which would stop business.

ξ 3. rei, ‘feeling,' ‘condition.'

ς 4. umbram nomenque. Cp. Cic. Att. 5. 15 ‘me nomen habere
duarum legionum exilium,’ and Plaut. Mil. 3. 1. 31 :·——

‘Umbra es amantum magis quam amator.'

ultro, i. e. non petenti, ‘unasked.' ultro, lit. ‘beyond‚' implies that
