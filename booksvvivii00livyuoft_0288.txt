10. rei publicae, dative after ‘ servire.’
5 6. seditiosis, ‘inflammatory.’
contio is used both of ‘ a meeting' ancl os a ‘ harangue ' delivered
at a meeting.
arguendo. The ablative of the gerund is used in Latin where
Greek would usually have a participle in agreement with the substantive.
See Excursus, p. 2 3.
ξ 7. tertium. The years are reckoned from the time when winter
service began.
pueros . . . extractos. It is worth noticing that Livy's choice os
words very aptly reproduces the emphatic language that would be
employed by the speakers.
ξ 9. vectigalis . . . facta sit, ‘has been brought to the worst form
(extremity) of taxation.'
affecta, ‘ ruined,‘ ‘exhausted.‘ Cp. ¹7. 27. 4.
re familiari. The regular phrase for property, because the ‘ pater-
familias‚' or head of the family, was the responsible owner according to
the civil law.

ξ 2. quondam. Cp. 3. 64. 65. Other readings are ‘quidam,' ‘ne-
quidquam.' ‘Quod petissent' depends upon ‘expugnasse.’ ‘Tribunos
plebis' has been conjectured, but on obviously insufficient grounds; and
Livy has said nothing about the ‘ tribuni militum’ having acted in this
matter: therefore Madvig inclines to bracket ‘tribunos militum’ as
doubtful. The ‘lex Trebonia,’ B.C. 448 (3. 65), provided that if, in the
case of an election of tribunes of the plebs, the places were not filled up,
the presiding official should continue the voting until the number was
completed.
