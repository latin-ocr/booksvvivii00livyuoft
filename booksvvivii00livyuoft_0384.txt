This sketch of the early history os the drama at Rome has to be
supplemented by scattered passages from poets and grammarians. The
chief facts which we gather are 2—(1) The early existence of rude
elements os drama in Italy in the form of Fescennine verses, saturae, &c.
(2) The introduction os more elaborate music and dancing from Etruria.
The rude native acting becomes more conventional and artistic. Livius
introduces regular dialogue and plot, and separates singer and actor:
with this the drama proper begins, following Greek models. The
Satura, in the old sense, goes, its place being taken by the Atellan
playS, which are acted as after-pieces and retain an amateur character,
when acting generally has become professional.
