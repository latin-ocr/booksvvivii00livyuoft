Raram· and Accensz‘ (Livy 8. 8). Their place was afterwards
taken by the W’lz'les. The exact numbers of the different divi-
sions at this time is uncertain. In the time of Polybius (circ.
146 B.C.) sor a normal legion of 4200, they were——

Hastati, 10 maniples of 120= 1200

Principes, ‚‚ „ = 1200
Triarii, „ 60= 600
Velites, = 1200

Besides this there were 300 cavalry ίο a legion, ten turmae of
thirty each.

The Hastati first advanced to battle, leaving their standards
(szgna) behind them to mark their position. If they failed they
withdrew behind the Principes, who in their turn advanced to
the front. If they were beaten, both Hastati and Principes
retired into the gaps between the maniples of Triarii, and the
whole body then advanced in close order.

The term antesigyzam' (Livy 7. 33. 9; 9. 39. 7, ἃς.) is applied
to the troops who at any time have advanced beyond the szgna
manipulorum, i. e. at the beginning of a battle the Hastati, or
later on the Principes, if they advanced in their turn.

The advantage of this manipular arrangement was its ease of
movement and independence of difficulties of ground, Livy 9.

ris, Romana acies distinctior, ex pluribus partibus constans,
facilis paitienti, quacunque opus esset, facilis iungenti.’

Armament.-—The heavy troops wore a bronze helmet, a
shield (scutum), greaves, and a leather corslet (lm'ca), some-
times covered with metal rings.

Their arms of offenee were :—

(1) Tltepike (hasla), originally, no doubt, the weapon of the
Hastati in the old phalanx, now that of the Triarii: who knelt
behind the two front divisions with the hasla sloped forwards
over their heads, Livy 8. 8.

(2) leejavelz'n (pilum) a weapon sor hurling. It consisted
of a long wooden shaft with an iron shaft of the same length
fastened to it so as to reach half-way along the wood, the length
