INTRODUCTION.

THE events narrated in the three Books comprised in this
edition fall within the dates 403 B. c. to 342 B. c. (A. U. c. 351 to
413). For a summary of them Mommsen, Hissory os Rome,
book ii. Chapters 3, 4, and 5 may be consulted. Much that is
legendary is interwoven with the narrative as presented by
Livy. Even when dealing with events of a later date and of
comparatively greater importance (e. g. the campaigns of
Hannibal), the historiari of Rome has been shown to have
been more than once wanting in accuracy, even if not inclined
to a remissness which one might reasonably expect to be
avoided. But criticisms, more or less sweeping and dogmatic,
may be found in the works of those able writers who have
enriched the literature of the present century with their re-
searches into the truthsulness of Roman history. It is not our
intention to repeat them here. Only it may be remarked, in
justice to Livy, that he was himself fully aware of the legendary
and poetical nature of many of the tales which he had to record,
and which had become part of the cherished traditions of his
country-men. He had set himself the task of compiling the
records of the Roman people from the earliest times; and the
writers of the Augustan period had no tendency to deal with
the past in a critical or sceptical spirit. The rules of historical
criticism are of modern growth, and are perhaps scarcely yet
finally settled; therefore allowance can fairly be made for a
writer who, in presence of the world—wide majesty of the nation to
which he belonged, declined to startle his readers by refuting
or even seriously questioning those facts which threw a glamour
over the history of their ancestors, and to whose judgment
poetical justice rather than dispassionate investigation seemed
best adapted to the traditional records of bygone days.
