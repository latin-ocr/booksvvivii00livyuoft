CJJAP. XXXI. ξ 6-ΧΧΛ7Η. ξ 2.

quae una erat=their only help : ‘they tlirust out from the city the Chap,

one and only man who could help them, M. Furius Camillus.' 32.
ξ 8. Qui, &c. The sentence is valuable as a good specimen of com-

plex construction, which in English would stand as several co-ordinatc
clauses. ‘ He was summoned to trial by L. Apuleius to answer sor the
plunder from Veii. About that time he had lost his grown-up son. On
calling a meeting at his house of his tribesmen and dependents, chiefly
plebeians, and asking their opinions, he received the answer, that they
would contribute any fine which he might be condemned to pay, but
could not aequit him. So he went into exile.’

praedam Veientanam. Evidently, so sar as Livy tells us, a con—
sequence of the unpopularity os Camillus in regard to the ‘ donum Apol-
linis.’ lNhether there were any grounds for a legitimate condemnation
is not recorded.

magna pars, this must=of whom more than half were plebeians:
‘quae'z‘quorum.’ The dependents of Camillus alone could not be
¹ more than half the plebs ;’ ‘ plebis ' z‘de plebe!

quanti, of price, amount. Cp. Hor. Sat. 2. 3. 156 2——

‘Quanti emptae? Parvo. Quanti ergo? Octussibus.'
ξ 9. si innoxio, ⁴ if he were undeserving of the wrong done to him.'

primo quoque, ‘at each first‚' i.e. ‘at the earliest moment,’ ‘ as
soon as possible.' ‘Quisque' is used by the best writers, especially in
prose, only with ‘ suus,’ ‘ut‚' a superlative, or some relative pronoun
ς’ quod,’ ‘quando'). Lucretius and earlier writers use it absolutely:
every one.

desiderium sui, ‘ might cause his thankless country to mourn his
absence ; ’ cp. πόθος.

§ 1. si quicquam. The double genitive is idiomatic, almost as it Chal).
were by combining two phrases ‘ aliquid certi,‘ and ‘ humanorum aliquid ’ 33.
-—‘ if anything human is certain.' At the outset of this history of disaster
from § 6 of the previous chapter, the writer's language becomes more
impressive and solemn. This is Livy‘s most admirable talent, and one
in the exercise of which he seldom fails to rivet attention.

fatali, ‘ doomed.'

Clusini. Clusium is near the Lacus Trasimenus, on a river named
the Clanis, in Etruria. 1t was one of the great cities of the Etruscans,
Falerii, Veii, Capena, Tarquinii. Volsci, Caere, Volsinii, Faesulae, and
Cortona being the other principal cities of the ‘duodecim populi.’

ξ 2. nova . . . voluptate. We might expect the genitive, as the wine
caused or constituted the ‘ voluptas; ' or else ‘ vin0.‘

captam, ‘enticed‚’ ‘allured.’ Used with all kinds of ablatives—
‘ capta cupidine‚’ ‘ auribus,' ‘oculis,’ ‘ mente captus.’
