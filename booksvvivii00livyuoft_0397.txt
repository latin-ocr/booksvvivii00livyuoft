plebs in Aventinum sevocanda esse videatur!

capite sanxerunt, ‘ made it a capital offence,' made a penal law
involving loss os ‘ caput? See 6. 4. 5, note.

nihil enim non, ‘ sor (they said) anything in the world could be
passed by soldiers who had swom obedience to the consu1.' Polyb. 6. 21
quotes the words of the oath ἧ μὴν πειθαρχήσειν καὶ ποιήσειν τὸ προσ-
ταττόμενον itm) τῶν ἀρχόντων κατὰ δι’]ναμιν. This warning against the
undue influence of the army is justified by the later history of Rome,
when it had become a purely prosessional body. In the last century of
the Republic, when the Senate was corrupt, and the ‘comitia' only
represented a fraction of the citizens, the situation was decided in turn
by the armies of Marius, Sulla, Pompey, and Caesar; and the principate
established by Augustus tested on his command of the armies of the
state.

5 7. ferente, ‘ proposing.’

§ 8. utraque parte, ‘ on both banks of the Tiber‚' with oppressit, &e.

5 9. sine auctoritate, ‘ without their (formal) ratification.’

§ 10. Though the plebs had succeeded in electing men of their own
rank, the patres evidently retained abundant means of interserfflg, and
depriving them of the fruits of their success. In the interregnum the
patres appointed the interreges. For the patrum auctoritas cp. 6.
