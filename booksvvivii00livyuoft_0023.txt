ΟΝ soma 1³01sz m THE LANGUAGE AND STYLE or L1vv As
SHOWN IN BOOKs Ks—VII.

THE strength and weakness of Livy as a writer may be said
to lie in his rhetorical power. Sometimes perhaps the art is ill-
concealed, and the language overstrained‚ but on the whole the
impression produced is that of a writer with a wonderful gift for
turning to account the resources of his language. The great
characteristic of his style is its versatility‚ both of feeling and of
expression. Instances might be given in plenty from these
books of the wide range of his expression, from simple or pathetic
narrative to the strongest indignation and the most scathing
irony. A few passages are here quoted, in addition to those
referred to above (pp. 11, 12).
