8 JNTROD UCTJON.

The chief events included in these books are the siege and
capture of Veii by the Romans, and the subsequent capture of
Rome by the Gauls : the rise of the city from its ruins, and the
conflicts in which it was engaged against the waning power of
the Etruscan nation, more than once having again to encounter
the forces of the Celts who had inflicted so crushing a defeat on
the power of Rome: and the beginning of the war known as the
Samnite VVar. Internally there belongs to this period that
portion of the struggle of the Orders, of the Plebs against the
Patricians, which Mommsen terms ‘the equalization of the
orders and the new aristocracy.' The Licinio-Sextian laws
which established the absolute right of the plebeians to one of
the consulships‚ the appointment of plebeian Masters of the
Horse, and even a plebeian Dictator, broke down the long-
standing political distinctions and did away with the class t
privileges which had long made the patricians as such the
dominating power in Rome. The success of Licinius and his
colleagues was due to the fact that the leading plebeians (who
practically had as little sympathy as the patricians with the
special burdens ofthe proletariate) took advantage of the public
indignation against usury and the exactions of the capitalist
class to force their way to the highest offices of state. It is re-
markable that the Licinian laws were finally carried en masse——
the bulk of the plebs being indifferent to the political claims of
their leaders, provided some genuine relies against the burden
of debt were devised for themselves. But the leading plebeians
were not eager merely to remove the grievances of their poorer
fellow-citizens. To quote the words of Licinius as recorded by
Dio Cassius, ‘If the people would not eat, they should not
drink either3 ' and in the end, the aims of the compromise were
achieved. The first law was directed to a settlement of the
question of debt; the interest already paid by debtors was
to be deducted from the capital, and the remainder of the debt
to be paid within three years in equal instalments. The second
(which is not classed as agrarian by Livy) provided that no one
should hold as possessor more than 500 jugera of public land3
